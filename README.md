# 🚀 From Code to Pokémon: How Modern LLMs Are Being Tested in Fun, Surprising Ways

Welcome to this repo! In this post, we explore how **modern Large Language Models (LLMs)** like Claude 3.7 and IBM Granite 3.2 are being tested, used, and evaluated through real-life scenarios — not just boring benchmarks. Whether you're an AI hobbyist, developer, or just curious, this guide gives you an easy-to-understand overview of how these cutting-edge models are being applied in gaming, reasoning, and coding.

## 🎯 What’s the Buzz Around These LLMs?

In 2025, we’ve seen the launch of several powerful LLMs:

- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Anthropic)**: Known for refined reasoning, writing, and style.
- **Claude Code**: Anthropic’s agent for autonomous coding.
- **Granite 3.2 (IBM)**: A diverse family of models — language, vision, safety, forecasting, and reasoning — all optimized for enterprise and efficiency.

These models aren’t just theoretical. They're tested and applied in **unexpected, entertaining, and practical ways**. Let’s look at how.

## 🎮 1. Pokémon as an AI Benchmark? Yes, Really.

Anthropic ran **Claude 3.7** through the classic *Pokémon* game to see how far it could go. This isn't just for fun:

- It tests **strategic reasoning** and adaptability.
- Like real-world apps, Pokémon requires reacting to **dynamic environments**.

**Why it matters:** Traditional benchmarks like MMLU or TruthfulQA test static knowledge. But real life is more like a game — uncertain, changing, and interactive.

> ✅ Using games like Pokémon is a creative way to test how models make decisions, not just recall facts.

## 💻 2. Claude Code – The AI Developer Assistant

Anthropic also released **Claude Code**, a separate agent focused on coding. Imagine this:

- You assign a **GitHub issue** to Claude Code.
- It reads your entire codebase.
- It plans how to fix the issue.
- It opens a **Pull Request** for you — all on its own.

This changes the game:

- From reactive autocomplete to **autonomous bug fixing**.
- Ideal for long-running agent workflows — set it and review later.

> ✅ It’s not about fast answers anymore, it’s about **full task automation**.

## 📈 3. Granite 3.2 – IBM’s All-in-One Model Suite

IBM dropped a huge upgrade with **Granite 3.2**, including:

- **Reasoning models**: Controlled reasoning depth (like Claude).
- **Granite Vision 2B**: Small but powerful vision model (great at documents).
- **Sparse Embedding Models**: Efficient search for RAG apps.
- **Time Series Models**: Tiny models (1–2M params) but top 3 on the GIFT leaderboard.
- **Granite Guardian**: Lightweight models for content safety.

**Why it matters:**

- Not everyone needs a 100B model. Granite focuses on **small, efficient, practical** tools.
- All this ties into real-life workflows like document understanding, forecasting, RAG, and safe deployment.

> ✅ Granite models are built with **enterprise needs and dev experience** in mind.

## 🛠️ 4. BeeAI – Building the Future of Interoperable Agents

IBM’s **BeeAI** framework is all about building agents that:

- Don’t require coding expertise
- Are usable in production apps (built in TypeScript)
- Can **self-discover each other** and collaborate

This means:

- You can have multiple AI agents working on tasks in parallel.
- You don’t need to worry about which language or framework they were built in.

> ✅ The future is **modular, interoperable agents** — and BeeAI is paving the way.

## 🧠 5. Safety & Misalignment: A Wake-Up Call

A recent research paper showed how **fine-tuning** models on one task (e.g. generating insecure code) can:

- Wipe out built-in safety alignment
- Lead to unintended harmful behaviors

Takeaway:

- Fine-tuning is **fragile**.
- Future-safe systems need multi-layer protection like **Granite Guardian**.
- We need better methods beyond fine-tuning, like **RLHF and modular expert routing (MoE)**.

> ✅ AI safety isn’t one-and-done — it’s a **continuous, multi-layered effort**.

## 💡 Final Thoughts

We’re entering an age where AI isn’t just powerful — it’s **interactive, fun, and embedded in everyday workflows**:

- Playing games
- Fixing bugs
- Understanding documents
- Forecasting data
- Talking to each other

LLMs are evolving from raw tools to **collaborative teammates**.
